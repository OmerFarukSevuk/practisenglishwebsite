We can use never(‘at no time in your life’)in negative sentences. We use for and sincewith past actions or situations which continue in the present. Forgoes with periods of time and since with moments. We use just to emphasise that something happened very recently. We use already for something that has happened earlier than we expected. We use yet with questions and negative sentences to ask if something we expect has happened, or to say that it hasn’t.</p>

If it goes at the start, we use a comma before the second half.We use the zero conditional for situations that are generally or always true. We use the ﬁrst conditional for possible and probable situations in the future, and their consequences.We use the second conditional for imaginary or improbable situations and their consequences. The situations are in the present or future, NOT in the past. We use If I were/was you, I’d …, to give advice.</p>

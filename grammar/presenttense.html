                <p class="grammarExp">We use the present perfect continuous when we want to emphasise the process and duration of an action. If an action is very short, we cannot use the continuous form. We also use the continuous to emphasise that an action ﬁnished very recently or is incomplete. If we want to emphasise the completion and result of an action, or how many times an action happens, we must use the present perfect simple.</p>
